1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,093
英语语法之-过去完成进行时

2
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:12,466
例句1） Your eyes are red. You ve been crying haven t you?

3
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:18,240
例句2） Her eyes were red. It was obvious she had been crying.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,240
在例句1）中 由are可以知道 这里说话语境的时间是现在

5
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:33,094
所以后面用现在完成进行时have been crying来表达一个在“现在”说话时刻之前在延续的事件

6
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:35,761
即“现在刚刚”结束的事件

7
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:41,815
在例句2）中 由were可以知道 这里说话语境的时间是过去

8
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:46,841
此时要表达一个在“过去”说话时刻之前在延续的事件

9
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:52,735
即“过去刚刚”结束的事件就要用过去完成进行时had been crying

10
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:56,615
1）你的眼睛红红的 你刚才一直在哭吧?

11
00:00:56,616 --> 00:01:01,896
2）她的眼睛当时红红的 很明显 她之前一直在哭

12
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:08,416
过去完成进行时表示开始于过去某个时刻之前的动作持续到过去这一时刻

13
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,469
并继续持续下去

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,603
When I arrived in Inner Mongolia it had been snowing for half a month.

15
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:24,190
这里的arrived确立了过去的坐标时间 然后谈论在此之前发生的一个延续活动“下雪”

16
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:28,031
所以用过去完成进行时had been snowing

17
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:32,871
那次在我到内蒙古之前 雪已经下了整整半个月了

18
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:35,324
