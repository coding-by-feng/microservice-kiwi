1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,146
定语从句第一部分

2
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:14,013
在英文中 被定语从句所修饰的对象叫作antecedent 英文中对这个词的解释是a word

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,880
phrase clause

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,226
or sentence to which a pronoun refers

5
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:29,653
即表示“代词所指代的词、短语、从句或句子” 所以先行词可以是一个词、短语、分句或者独立的句子等

6
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,014
形容词作定语与从句作定语比较

7
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:38,120
当要表达复杂的意思时 往往需要借助于定语从句来完成

8
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,587
即要用定语从句来修饰某个名词或名词短语

9
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:50,201
比如当我们说“我不喜欢懒人” 这时只需要用一个形容词lazy来作定语就可以

10
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:52,788
I don t like lazy people.

11
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:59,094
如果要表达稍微复杂一点的意思 比如说“我不喜欢不守信用的人” 这时

12
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:02,721
简单地用形容词作定语就无能为力了

13
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:09,362
就要借助于一个句子来修饰名词 用作名词的定语 对名词进行限制

14
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:13,362
I don t like people who never keep their word.

15
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:17,935
定语从句的两个重要概念：先行词和关系词

16
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:22,042
被定语从句所修饰的对象称为先行词

17
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:31,695
重复指代先行词、起连接主句和从句的作用 并且在定语从句中充当一定成分的连接词称为关系词

18
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,829
关系词有两个作用：

19
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:40,202
代词的作用： 重复指代先行词并且在定语从句中充当一定成分

20
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:43,523
连接作用：即连接主句和从句

21
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,736
先行词的结构特点

22
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:52,029
先行词是一个词 可以是一个单词 通常是名词 也可以是代词

23
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:00,630
主要包括：人称代词he（其他人称代词不可以） 指示代词that/those 不定代词one等

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,990
比如例句：幸福与智慧的区别在于：认为自己最幸福的人 他真的就是最幸福

25
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,270
而认为自己最智慧的人 却往往是最大的傻瓜

26
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,016
There is this difference between happiness and

27
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:27,763
wisdom: he who thinks himself the happiest man really is so but he who thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.

28
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,604
再重复读一遍：

29
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:38,164
There is this difference between happiness and wisdom: he who thinks himself the happiest man really is so

30
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:44,630
but he who thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.

31
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,004
这里的两个定语从句的先行词都是代词he

32
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:54,084
注意：这里的he不是具体指某个人 而是表示泛指

33
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:58,737
一般来讲 人称代词后面是不能接定语从句的

34
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:05,271
比如我们不能说“We who think ourselves...” 或“You who think yourself...

35
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:12,592
等等 因为人称代词已经表达了一个完整的意思 不需要任何定语从句来修饰

36
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:18,658
但人称代词若是表示泛指 则可以接定语从句来进行修饰

37
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,845
只有那些有耐心将简单的事情做得完美的人

38
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:26,219
才能学会轻松地做好难事的技能

39
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:33,806
Only those who have the patience to do simple things perfectly will acquire the skill to do

40
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:36,419
difficult things easily.

41
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:46,192
Only those who have the patience to do simple things perfectly will acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.

42
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:55,859
这里的those指人 作先行词 被定语从句who have the patience to do simple things perfectly所修饰

43
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,046
先行词是一个短语

44
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:07,833
In Europe as elsewhere multi-media groups have been increasingly successful groups which bring together television

45
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:13,874
radio newspapers magazines and publishing houses that work in

46
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,447
relation to one another.

47
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:21,727
在欧洲 像在其他地方一样 多媒体集团越来越成功了

48
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:29,994
这些集团把相互间联系密切的电视台、电台、报纸、杂志以及出版社组合到了一起

49
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:32,808
In Europe as elsewhere

50
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:40,354
multi-media groups have been increasingly successful groups which bring together television

51
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,968
radio newspapers

52
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:48,728
magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another.

53
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:55,248
这里的关系词which指代的先行词是successful groups这个名词短语

54
00:04:55,248 --> 00:05:01,674
关系词that指代的先行词是television radio newspapers

55
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:05,835
magazines and publishing houses这个名词短语

56
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:08,075
先行词是一个分句

57
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,781
He said that he had no time

58
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:12,755
which isn't true.

59
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:16,208
他说他没有时间 事实并非如此

60
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:21,715
这里which指代的是一个宾语从句that he had no time

61
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:24,449
先行词是一个完整的句子

62
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,769
My girlfriend likes dancing with other guys which really drives me crazy.

63
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,316
我女友喜欢和别的小伙子跳舞 这让我十分恼火

64
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:41,303
先行词是my girlfriend likes dancing with other guys这一完整的句子

65
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,477
先行词的位置特点

66
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,624
先行词 加 其他定语 加 定语从句

67
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,664
这种情形最常见

68
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:56,850
这是由于先行词同时带有多个定语 定语从句与其他定语相比 一般较长

69
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,384
结构也较复杂 因此

70
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:03,890
按照英语的“尾重原则（principle of end weight）”

71
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:10,277
结构复杂的定语从句置于其他定语后边 从而造成与先行词隔离

72
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:14,811
The mineral elements from the soil that are usable

73
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:22,357
by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution before they can be taken into the root.

74
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:29,998
土壤中可供植物利用的矿物质只有先溶解在土壤中 然后才能被植物的根部吸收

75
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:33,891
先行词 加 状语 加 定语从句

76
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,118
造成先行词与关系词被分隔的第二种情形

77
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:46,064
就是在先行词与关系词之间插入一个状语 这个状语一般是修饰主句的谓语动词的

78
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:50,945
Never leave that until tomorrow which you can do today.

79
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:56,078
这里的先行词是that 定语从句是which you can do today

80
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:05,212
现在二者之间插入了一个时间状语until tomorrow来修饰leave 从而造成先行词与关系词被分隔

81
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:10,493
今日事 今日毕（不要把今天能做的事情留到明天做）

82
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:14,466
If there is anything in the world that a young man

83
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:24,920
should be more grateful for than another it is the poverty which necessitates starting life under very great disadvantage.

84
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:29,707
这里的关系代词that在从句中作介词for的宾语

85
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:36,628
对于青年人来说 如果世上真的有什么事物是他最应该感激的 那就是贫穷

86
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:41,574
因为贫穷能促使他在非常恶劣的环境下开创生活

87
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:46,601
作主语的先行词 加 谓语部分 加 定语从句

88
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:52,788
先行词与关系词被分隔的第三种情形就是两者被主句谓语隔开

89
00:07:52,789 --> 00:08:03,375
这是因为先行词在主句中作主语 然后它又被一个定语从句所修饰 而定语从句一般都会比主句谓语的结构复杂

90
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:08,602
因此 按照英语的“尾重原则（principle of end weight）”

91
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:15,936
结构复杂的定语从句置于主句谓语后边 从而造成关系词与先行词被隔离

92
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:19,029
It can be predicted however

93
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:27,150
that from time to time questions will arise which will require specific scientific answers.

94
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:35,456
然而 可以预见的是 将来会经常出现一些问题 这些问题需要给出专门的科学的回答

95
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:38,363
定语从句中的主谓一致问题

96
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:46,710
定语从句的谓语动词是用单数还是用复数 这不取决于关系词 而是由先行词决定的

97
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:56,284
Despite much research there are still certain elements in the life cycle of the insect that is not fully understood.

98
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:58,257
is 应改为are

99
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:08,031
这里先行词elements与关系词that被分隔 因为elements还有一个后置定语in the life cycle of the insect

100
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:13,605
显然 这种分隔属于：先行词+其他定语+定语从句

101
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:21,086
that指代elements 在从句中作主语 所以 谓语动词要用复数形式的are

102
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:24,459
关系词在定语从句中充当的成分

103
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,992
关系词用作从句的主语

104
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:29,539
比较简单句和定语从句

105
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,433
看看一个简单句如何变成定语从句

106
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:38,380
The woman is a famous dancer and she lives next door.

107
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,873
这个句中有一个“重复元素” 这里的she指代 the woman 即两句之间有一个交叉点

108
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:50,007
而通过这个交叉点建立起两句之间的联系

109
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:54,927
现在要用she lives next door来作定语修饰the woman

110
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,101
以告诉对方哪位女士是舞蹈演员

111
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:02,301
而在定语从句中 指代“人”的关系词要用who

112
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,354
因此

113
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,368
上句可改写成：

114
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:11,448
The woman is a famous dancer who (=and she) lives next door.

115
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:21,302
这里的关系词who既取代了代词she也取代了连词and 即who既具有代词的作用也起着连接的作用

116
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:26,396
另外 定语从句一般要紧跟在它所修饰的名词后面

117
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:30,036
因此 上一句又可进一步改写成：

118
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:33,449
The woman who lives next door is a

119
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,330
famous dancer.

120
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:43,090
由此看到 关系词who既指代the woman 同时又在从句中作主语 而且还替换了and

121
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,956
起着连词的作用

122
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:50,290
这位女士是一名著名的舞蹈演员 她就住在我家隔壁

123
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,091
在变换过程中要注意三点：

124
00:10:53,091 --> 00:11:01,704
用关系词who代替人称代词（如she或they）后 定语从句里就不能再保留这些代词了

125
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:03,398
比如不能说：

126
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:08,371
The woman who she lives next door is a famous dancer.

127
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:12,478
I like guys who they have a good sense of humor.

128
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:17,905
事实上 定语从句可以修饰一个主句当中的任何一个名词

129
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:27,572
但是 我们关注的往往是关系词在定语从句中所充当的成分 不关心定语从句是修饰主句的哪个名词

130
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:36,186
定语从句的谓语动词形式是由关系词所指代的先行词来决定的 而不是取决于关系词本身

131
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:44,760
定语从句who lives next door中的who指代的woman是单数名词 故谓语用单数的lives

132
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,960
而定语从句who have a good sense of

133
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:53,947
humor中的who指代的guys是复数名词 故谓语用复数的have

134
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:58,427
Anger is a thief who steals away the nice moments.

135
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:02,908
愤怒就如同一个窃贼 盗取了我们的幸福时光

136
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:09,508
He who is not handsome at twenty nor strong at thirty nor rich at forty

137
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:16,228
nor wise at fifty will never be handsome strong rich or wise.

138
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:23,708
一个人若在20岁时不俊美、30岁时不健康、40岁时不富有、50岁时不明智

139
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,628
那么他将永远不会拥有这些

140
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:35,774
There is this difference between happiness and wisdom: the person who thinks himself the happiest man really is so

141
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:42,801
but the person who thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.

142
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:49,055
幸福与智慧区别于此：认为自己是最幸福的 他真的就是最幸福的

143
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:53,762
而认为自己是最有智慧的 他却往往是最大的傻瓜

144
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:59,389
The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.

145
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:05,643
世界犹如一本书 而那些从不出门旅行的人仅仅读了这本书的一页

146
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:10,776
Of course I am not talking about easy-come-easy-go

147
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:12,097
friendship.

148
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:21,043
I m talking about friends who care deeply about each other who support each other who make life worth living.

149
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:30,924
当然了 我这里所说的友谊不是那种“来得快去得也快”的泛泛之交 而是那种彼此之间能真正互相关心的朋友

150
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:36,110
能够互相支持的朋友 能够让你的人生更有意义的朋友

151
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:39,284
关系词用作从句中动词的宾语

152
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:45,151
关系词除了在定语从句中作主语外 还可以在从句中作宾语

153
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:51,004
而且 还可以进一步区分为从句动词的宾语和从句介词的宾语

154
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:55,911
例句1) I'd really like to find a friend and I can

155
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:58,297
trust him completely.

156
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:04,977
例句2) I'd really like to find a friend I can trust who completely.

157
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:12,671
在例句1）中 这里的him指代名词短语a friend 可以用关系词who来替代him

158
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:15,084
充当动词trust的宾语

159
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:19,725
又因为who有连词的作用 所以此时and就要去掉了

160
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,765
如例句2）所示

161
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:28,325
另一方面 关系词who要置于从句的开头 所以要把who移到I的前面

162
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,378
原句从而变成了下面的例句3）：

163
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:35,005
3）I d really like to find a friend

164
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:38,098
who I can trust completely.

165
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:41,925
我想找一个我完全能够信任的人做朋友

166
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:46,178
He is the best grammar teacher who I have ever

167
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:47,205
seen.

168
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:50,352
他是我见过的最好的语法老师

169
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,872
It s hard to have a friend who you can trust

170
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,566
completely.

171
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:58,793
很难有一个你能完全信任的朋友

172
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:01,953
关系词用作从句中介词的宾语

173
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:05,406
例句1) I'm talking about friends and

174
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:09,153
you can share almost everything with them.

175
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:13,740
例句2) I'm talking about friends who you can share

176
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:16,141
almost everything with.

177
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:19,621
这里的who充当介词with的宾语

178
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:25,354
我这里说的朋友 是指那些你几乎可以把一切与之分享的人

179
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:31,475
I hope I never have a boss who I can t talk to about my problems.

180
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:34,781
这里的who充当介词to的宾语

181
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:39,195
我不希望有一个无法与其谈论我的问题的老板

182
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:46,235
I d prefer someone who I have something in common with — who I can talk to easily.

183
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:51,182
这里的关系词who分别充当介词with和to的宾语

184
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:55,516
我喜欢那些与我有共同点的人 这样易交流

185
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:58,222
作宾语的关系词可以省去

186
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:03,542
不论关系词是作动词的宾语还是作介词的宾语都可以省去

187
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:08,116
比如以上讨论过的相关例句 可以分别改写成：

188
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:14,743
I d really like to find a friend (关系词省略) I can trust completely.

189
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:22,116
I hope I never have a boss (关系词省略) I can t talk to about my problems.

190
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:25,716
在从句中作主语的关系词无法省去

191
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,677
比如不能这样说：

192
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:32,943
I like guys (关系词不能省略) have a good sense of humor.

193
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:36,304
关系代词与先行词的搭配关系

194
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:37,970
先行词指“人”

195
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,464
用关系代词who或whom

196
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:42,477
who和whom的区别

197
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,837
who的前面不能与介词搭配使用

198
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,544
因为who是主格

199
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:54,398
形式 所以在介词的后面不能用who 比如不说with who 而说with whom

200
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:58,718
I m talking about friends who you can share almost

201
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,505
everything with.

202
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:06,412
不能说“I m talking about friends with who you can share almost everything.”

203
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:12,786
而应该说“I m talking about friends with whom you can share almost everything.”

204
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:20,293
主格形式的who除了作定语从句的主语外 还可以充当定语从句的宾语或表语

205
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:23,480
whom在定语从句中不能作主语

206
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,787
但可作宾语或表语

207
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:32,267
A rich person is not one who has the most but is one who needs the least.

208
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:37,774
一个富有的人 不是因为他拥有的最多 而是因为他需要的最少

209
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:43,375
这里的who作从句的主语 所以不能用whom 不说whom has…

210
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,588
Only the people who have the patience to do simple

211
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:53,802
things perfectly will acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.

212
00:17:53,803 --> 00:18:00,083
只有有耐心圆满完成简单工作的人 才能够轻而易举地完成困难的事

213
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:05,616
这里的who作从句的主语 所以不能用whom 不说whom have…

214
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:13,270
总之 who可以作主语 也可以代替whom作宾语或表语 但不能用在介词后面

215
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:17,431
而因为whom是宾格形式 所以不能作主语

216
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,831
表示人或物的所有关系 用whose

217
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:26,431
whose表示所有关系 其作用就如同物主代词my your

218
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,137
her his their和our whose的后面要接名词

219
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:33,497
whose可指人也可指物

220
00:18:33,498 --> 00:18:40,684
“whose+名词”在从句中可作主语、动词的宾语或介词的宾语 whose同that一样

221
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,324
既可以指人 也可以指物

222
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,031
I know a friend.

223
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:47,898
His brother is a pop singer.

224
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:52,125
I know a friend whose bropther is a pop singer.

225
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,111
我认识一个朋友 他哥哥是一名流行歌手

226
00:18:56,112 --> 00:19:02,578
例句2）里的whose代替了例句1）里的his 指friend 即表示人

227
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:05,245
When I looked through the window

228
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:09,299
I saw a girl whose beauty took my breath away.

229
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:15,152
当我朝窗外看去 猛然看见一个美女 其美貌让我惊讶不已

230
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:20,126
这里的whose beauty作从句的主语 whose指人即a girl

231
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:24,153
It was a meeting whose importance I did not

232
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,539
realize at the time.

233
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,339
这个会议的重要性当时我并没有意识到

234
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:34,886
这里的whose importance作从句动词realize的宾语

235
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,207
whose指物即a meeting

236
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,753
先行词指“物” 用关系代词which

237
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:43,500
We are studying sentences.

238
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,473
They contain adjective clauses.

239
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:52,287
We are studying sentences which contain adjective clauses.

240
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,847
我们正在学习带有定语从句的句子

241
00:19:55,848 --> 00:20:00,768
这里的先行词是sentences 表示“物” 因此不能用who

242
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:07,914
要用which代替they 指代sentences 告诉对方“我们正在学习什么类型的句子”

243
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:14,221
关系词which所指代的先行词比较复杂 它除了可以指单个的名词外

244
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,248
还可以指代短语甚至是从句

245
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,729
先行词是单个的名词

246
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:24,422
Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.

247
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,289
愤怒是吹灭心灵之灯的风

248
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,422
先行词是wind 即which指单个的名词

249
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:39,169
Perhaps it is human to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have

250
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,115
not.

251
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:44,262
先行词是that 即which指单个的名词

252
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:49,315
或许 “不惜已获 贪求不得”是人类共同的弱点吧

253
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,502
先行词是一个短语

254
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,062
which可以指代一个短语

255
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:59,009
He likes climbing mountains which is a good exercise.

256
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,796
先行词是主句中的一个动名词短语climbing mountains

257
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,423
他喜欢爬山 这是一项很好的运动

258
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,610
先行词是一个句子

259
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,997
which可以指代前面的整个句子

260
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:17,264
He tore up my photo which upset me.

261
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:20,970
他把我的照片给撕了 这让我很生气

262
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,704
全句“he tore up my photo”作which的先行词

263
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:27,584
that可以指代“人”

264
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:29,250
也可以指代“物”

265
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,730
关系代词that的意义和用法主要有以下三点：

266
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,130
that既可指“人”也可指“物”

267
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:40,491
指“物”时可以替换which 指“人”时可以替换who

268
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:43,931
that不用在非限制性定语从句中

269
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,624
that不能用于介词的后面（同who一样）

270
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:54,077
Too many people spend money which they haven t earned to buy things which they don t want

271
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:57,571
to impress people who they don t like.

272
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:04,371
太多的人花他们还没挣到的钱 买他们不想要的东西 取悦他们不喜欢的人

273
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:13,172
可以用that替换其中的which和who而将这句话改写成“Too many people spend money that they haven t earned

274
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:18,825
to buy things that they don t want to impress people that they don t like.

275
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:24,506
这里that的先行词有“物（money和things）” 也有“人（people）”

276
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:27,092
作宾语的关系词可以省去

277
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:36,973
因此这句话也可说成“Too many people spend money (省略) they haven t earned to buy things (省略) they don t want

278
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:40,986
to impress people (省略) they don t like.”

279
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:44,586
that与which和who在用法上的区别：

280
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:47,666
- 先行词中同时出现“人”和“物”时

281
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:55,040
用that The writer and his novels that the article deals with are quite familiar to us.

282
00:22:55,041 --> 00:23:00,721
这篇文章里所说的这个作家以及他的小说 我们都比较熟悉

283
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:04,521
这里的先行词是the writer and his novels

284
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:11,667
即同时有“人（writer）”和“物（his novels）” 所以要选用that引导定语从句

285
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:18,601
先行词为指“物”的all little few much none和the first时 用that

286
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,601
All that glitters is not gold.

287
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,108
闪光的并非都是金子

288
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:28,934
这里的先行词是all 所以用that来引导定语从句

289
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:36,148
另外要注意的是 这里有一个半否定的问题：all什么什么not要译成“并非都是”

290
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:39,189
不能译成全否定的“所有都不”

291
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:42,709
The book contains little that is useful.

292
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:45,842
这本书里几乎没有有用的东西

293
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:54,189
这里的先行词是表示否定意义的代词little（几乎没有什么） 所以用that来引导定语从句

294
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,376
There is not much that can be done.

295
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,576
这没有什么可以做的了

296
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:04,936
这里的先行词是代词much 所以用that来引导定语从句

297
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:12,043
As long as you stand up to the difficulties there are none that cannot be overcome.

298
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:16,550
只要你勇敢地去面对困难 就没有什么克服不了的

299
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,897
这里的先行词是代词none 所以用that来引导定语从句

300
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:27,804
先行词是不定代词something anything nothing和everything时

301
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:29,458
一般用that

302
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:36,271
先行词被any only all every no some much few

303
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:46,005
little 序数词 形容词的最高级 the only the one the very the right和the last等成分修饰时

304
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:49,539
用that Tell us all things that you know.

305
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:52,219
把你知道的都告诉我们

306
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:56,699
The very problem that I want to solve is like this.

307
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,606
我想解决的问题就像这个一样

308
00:24:59,606 --> 00:25:03,980
He is the only man that can speak four foreign

309
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,900
languages in our company.

310
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,820
他是我们公司唯一一个会说四种外语的人

311
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,113
that不用在非限制性定语从句中

312
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,700
I became a single mother

313
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,153
overnight which is nothing like becoming famous overnight.

314
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:27,366
我在一夜之间成了单亲妈妈 这跟一夜成名可完全不同

315
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:35,087
不能说“I became a single mother overnight that is nothing like becoming famous overnight.”

316
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:37,607
that不能用于介词后面

317
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:44,713
The world in which we live is made up of matter. 我们所生活的世界是由物质组成的

318
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:49,340
或：The world which we live in is made up of matter.

319
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,874
或：The world that we live in is made up of matter.

320
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:58,794
但不能说“The world in that we live is made up of matter.”

321
00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:01,420
介词 加 关系代词

322
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,247
看从句选介词

323
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:09,021
所用介词须与定语从句中的动词构成固定搭配（最常见）

324
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:14,048
这里所说的动词往往是指定语从句中的谓语动词

325
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:17,754
The girl with whom you work is his girlfriend.

326
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:21,274
和你一起工作的女孩是他的女朋友

327
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:29,501
关系词whom前面的介词with与定语从句中的谓语动词work构成固定搭配work with

328
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,888
表示“和……一起工作”

329
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:35,982
He is the man on whom I think you can depend.

330
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:38,822
他是我认为你可以信赖的人

331
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:46,756
关系词whom前面的介词on与定语从句中的谓语动词depend构成固定搭配depend on

332
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:48,289
表示“依靠”

333
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:50,223
看从句的形容词：

334
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:55,929
所用介词须与定语从句中的形容词构成搭配（比较常见）

335
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,836
如果定语从句的谓语不是一个实义动词

336
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:07,143
而是由be动词与某个形容词构成的 我们则要使用与该形容词搭配的介词

337
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:11,143
He referred me to some reference books with which

338
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:13,877
I am not very familiar.

339
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:17,704
他让我参考的几本书我一本也不熟悉

340
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:26,504
关系词which前面的介词with与定语从句谓语部分中的 形容词familiar构成固定搭配be

341
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:30,610
familiar with sth. 表示“对……熟悉”

342
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:37,930
They will pass along their fresh impressions to the youth groups in which they are active.

343
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:43,917
他们会把自己获得的新鲜印象与他们积极参与的青年团体分享

344
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:54,278
关系词which前面的介词in与定语从句谓语部分中的形容词active构成固定搭配be active in sth.

345
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:56,184
表示“积极参与”

346
00:27:56,185 --> 00:28:03,185
看从句的名词：所用介词须与定语从句中的某个名词构成搭配（较少用）

347
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:07,505
Many hypersomniacs suffer from narcolepsy

348
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:11,945
for which the primary symptom is excessive daytime

349
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:13,678
sleepiness.

350
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:21,225
许多嗜睡的人都患有发作性嗜睡病 其早期症状就是在白天都极度想睡觉

351
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:30,025
这里的关系词which前面的介词for与定语从句中的名词symptom构成固定搭配symptom for

352
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,158
表示“是……症状”

353
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,439
看先行词选介词

354
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:41,172
The ease with which Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence was unbelievable.

355
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:48,279
这个复杂的句子 张老师能够如此轻而易举地分析出来 真是让人难以置信

356
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,200
拆分句子如下：

357
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,986
Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence with ease and the ease was unbelievable.

358
00:28:56,986 --> 00:29:00,746
把the ease was unbelievable作为主句

359
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:08,413
将Mr.Zhang cracked the complex sentence with ease作为定语从句来修饰the ease

360
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,080
将这两句合并起来就是：

361
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:18,347
The ease （Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence with ease） was unbelievable.

362
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:24,681
先行词是ease 所以我们用关系词which来指代 再将上句改写成：

363
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:28,254
The ease （Mr. Zhang cracked the complex

364
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:31,841
sentence with which） was unbelievable.

365
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:35,375
关系词which应该放在从句的开头

366
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:44,308
又因为with which（就相当于 with ease）是一个固定搭配 所以要将with which一同移到句子开头

367
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:47,109
于是上句就进一步改写成：

368
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:54,242
The ease （with which Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence） was unbelievable.

369
00:29:54,243 --> 00:30:01,349
常见的有：with ease at the rate in the direction to the extent to the degree

370
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:06,323
at the temperature by the means by the mode in a culture

371
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:08,403
in practice等等

372
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:12,616
at the speed和at the rate 表示“以这种速度”

373
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:16,749
The speed at which an animal lives is determined

374
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,256
by measuring the rate at which it uses oxygen.

375
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:27,030
通过测定动物消耗氧气的速率可以测定该动物的生长速度

376
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,696
to the extent 表示“在某种程度上”

377
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:38,350
When television was first introduced the extent to which it would affect human society

378
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,803
could not have been foreseen.

379
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:47,416
人们发明电视的时候 并没能预见到它会对人类社会产生多大的影响

380
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,790
by the means 表示“通过这种方式”

381
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:58,523
Public marches are an effective means by which the people can bring social inequalities to the

382
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,830
attention of government officials.

383
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:08,830
by which就等于说by the means 表示“通过这种方式” 在定语从句中作状语

384
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,844
修饰从句的谓语

385
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:18,777
公众通过游行示威这种方式 可以有效地让政府官员们注意到不平等的社会现实

386
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:23,698
表示所属关系或部分与整体的关系时用介词of

387
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:29,778
The company of which Max Harrison was until recently the chairman

388
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:33,578
has made loss of three million pounds this year.

389
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:37,298
这里的of which相当于of the company

390
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:45,351
于是整个定语从句相当于Max Harrison was until recently the chairman of the company

391
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,404
所以这里的of表示所属关系

392
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,698
即the chairman是属于这个公司的

393
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:58,858
原定语从句可以改写为：the chairman of which was Max Harrison until recently

394
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:06,245
这家公司今年亏损达三百万英镑 直到前不久Max Harrison还是它的董事长

395
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:13,872
该句型的结构往往是“不定代词/数量词/形容词的比较级或最高级+of which/whom”

396
00:32:13,872 --> 00:32:16,606
用来表示数量或某种特点

397
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:24,406
具体来讲 在介词of前面常出现的词包括：all each both either neither

398
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:30,032
none little few many much some most any

399
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:38,326
the majority half several a number half none以及数字和形容词的最高级等等

400
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:44,220
值得注意的是 这里of前面的成分都可以后移至定语从句中

401
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:46,301
固定的介宾结构

402
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:51,514
关系代词前面的介词有时与固定的介宾短语结构有关

403
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:58,661
比如in this case in one's honor和with one's help等 它们若出现在定语从句中

404
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:01,568
则会相应地变成in which case

405
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:04,409
in whose honor和with whose help

406
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:08,969
He may be late in which case we should wait for him.

407
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:13,755
他可能要迟到 如果是这样 我们就应该等等他

408
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:18,809
这里的in which case就是由短语in this case变过来的

409
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,289
这里which指前面整个句子“he may be late”

410
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:25,742
定语从句的倒装结构

411
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:31,462
具体的结构就是“介词+关系代词+从句谓语+从句主语”

412
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:36,436
即一个将整个谓语放在主语前面的全部倒装结构

413
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:42,343
This is the world out of which grows the hope for the first time in history

414
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:49,023
of a society where there will be freedom from want and freedom from fear.

415
00:33:49,023 --> 00:33:52,969
第一个定语从句out of which grows the hope

416
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:58,196
for the first time in history of a society修饰world

417
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:02,690
在这个定语从句里有一个倒装结构和分隔结构

418
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:10,210
分隔结构是在the hope和of a society中间插入了短语for the first time in history

419
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,316
也就是说 如果没有这个插入语

420
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:18,263
就是the hope of a society 表示“希望建立这样一个社会”

421
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:22,477
整个短语the hope for the first time in history

422
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:31,997
of a society就表示“在人类历史上 首次希望建立这样一个社会” 这个名词短语是作定语从句的主语

423
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:42,023
定语从句的谓语是grows out of which在定语从句中作状语 所以整个定语从句是一个全部倒装结构

424
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:51,757
正常语序应该是：the hope for the first time in history of a society grows out of which （out of the world）

425
00:34:51,758 --> 00:35:00,304
第二个定语从句where there will be freedom from want and freedom from fear修饰society

426
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:02,491
说明是什么样的社会

427
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:08,985
难点是如何翻译freedom from want and freedom from fear这个短语

428
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:15,199
这里freedom from来自于形容词短语free from 表示“免除 没有”

429
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,266
另外 名词want表示“贫困”

430
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:23,292
因此 整个短语我们可以译成“摆脱贫困 摆脱恐惧”

431
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:29,972
The intellectual process I learned in that class is also life's process

432
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:38,479
because every life is a great work with all the richness of its gifts and the wealth of its possibilities.

433
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:41,306
When you graduate from here

434
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:52,120
you exit with thousands of pages of personal text on which are inscribed beliefs and values shaped by years of education

435
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,427
family interactions

436
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:57,840
relationships experiences.

437
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,773
And buried within those thousands of pages is your personal truth your essence.

438
00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:12,000
这段话来自惠普公司总裁在斯坦福大学的一次毕业典礼上对毕业生们的演讲

439
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:18,881
定语从句on which are inscribed beliefs and values shaped by years of education

440
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:22,561
family interactions relationships

441
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:28,734
experiences修饰名词短语thousands of pages of personal text

442
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:33,467
该从句的主语是beliefs and values shaped by years of

443
00:36:33,468 --> 00:36:41,774
education family interactions relationships experiences 谓语是are inscribed

444
00:36:41,774 --> 00:36:44,161
on which作地点状语

445
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:53,082
所以 整个定语从句是一个全部倒装结构 正常语序是：beliefs and values shaped by years of

446
00:36:53,082 --> 00:37:05,042
education family interactions relationships experiences are inscribed on which （on thousands of pages of personal text）

447
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:10,068
我在那门课中所学的掌握知识的过程 也是生活的过程

448
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:17,295
因为每种人生都是一部伟大的著作 其中包含丰富的才智和美好的 可能

449
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:22,909
当你从这里毕业时 你会带着数千页的人生教科书走出校门

450
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:32,550
在这本教科书里铭刻着经过多年教育、家庭的作用、社会关系以及个人经历所形成的信念和价值观

451
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,483
而真实的你和你的精华就深藏在这数千页记录中

452
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:41,003
“介词+关系代词+ to do”结构

453
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:44,136
例句1） The farmer used wood to

454
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,750
build a house in which he could store grains.

455
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,937
例句2） The farmer used wood to build a house in which to store grains.

456
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:56,550
由1）句简化为2）句

457
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:05,444
先是把定语从句in which he could store grains中的主语he省去（因为he与主句主语the farmer一致

458
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:07,097
所以可以省略）

459
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:17,151
然后把情态动词could替换为不定式to（因为不定式具有情态意义） 于是便得到in which to store grains

460
00:38:17,152 --> 00:38:22,645
这位农夫用一些木材建造了一座房子 在那里储存粮食

461
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:31,632
还可以进一步简化上面的例句2） 就是把关系词which去掉 此时就必须把介词in移到句末去

462
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:37,353
例句3） The farmer used wood to build a house to store grains in.

463
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:39,139
- 在例句1）中

464
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:45,940
是一个定语从句（in which he could store grains）作后置定语 修饰house

465
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,660
- 在例句2）中

466
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:54,713
则是一个“半定语从句半不定式”的混合形式（in which to store grains）作后置定语

467
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:56,406
修饰house

468
00:38:56,407 --> 00:39:03,927
- 在例句3）中 则是一个不定式（to store grains in）作后置定语 修饰house

469
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:07,593
在使用这一结构时应注意以下几点：

470
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:11,873
“介词+关系代词”不能用一个关系副词来替换

471
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:18,114
比如不能说“The farmer used wood to build a house where to store grains.”

472
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:22,540
有介词、有关系代词时 不能将介词置于句末

473
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:28,794
比如不能说“The farmer used wood to build a house which to store grains in. ”

474
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:35,315
若没有介词 我们不能采用“半定语从句半不定式”的混合形式作后置定语

475
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:40,675
比如不能说“I can't think of anybody whom to invite.”

476
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:44,955
而要说“I can't think of anybody to invite.

477
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:54,141
或者“I can't think of anybody who I should invite.”
