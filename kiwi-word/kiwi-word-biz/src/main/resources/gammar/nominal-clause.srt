1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,213
简单句与名词从句

2
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,133
何谓名词从句？

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:11,694
在英语中 名词或名词短语主要充当四种句子成分：主语、宾语、表语和同位语

4
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:14,307
如果把句子当作名词来用

5
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,908
分别充当某句话的主语、宾语、表语或同位语

6
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:29,228
构成了四种从句：主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句和同位语从句 因为这四种从句在本质上相当于名词

7
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:32,094
所以将其统称为名词从句

8
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:38,321
相当于名词的句子有三类：陈述句、一般疑问句以及特殊疑问句

9
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:42,922
陈述句作句子成分 要在陈述句句首加上that

10
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:46,855
当把一个完整的陈述句当作名词来使用时

11
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:49,402
需要在陈述句句首加that

12
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:58,976
然后可使“that 加 陈述句”这一结构分别充当另一个句子的主语、宾语、表语或同位语等四种成分

13
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:04,390
即构成主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句或同位语从句

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,163
为什么要加that？

15
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:13,097
That English is important（主语从句）is an undoubted fact（谓语部分）.

16
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:17,057
英语很重要 这是一个毋庸置疑的事实

17
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:24,044
假如把that去掉 上句就变成“English is important is an undoubted fact.”

18
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:27,084
这句话就有两个中心谓语部分

19
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:30,938
即is important和is an undoubted fact

20
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:37,205
但是 在英语中 句子的核心意思主要是靠谓语部分来表达的

21
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:45,085
一个句子只表达一个核心意思（因为我们说话要一句一句地说） 也就只能有一个谓语部分

22
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:52,765
现在这个句子有两个谓语部分 读者就会纳闷：你要表达的意思到底是“某个东西重要”

23
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:55,658
还是要说“某个东西是事实”？

24
00:01:55,658 --> 00:02:02,511
为了避免混淆 在句首加上一个标志that 这里的that就相当于一个指路牌

25
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:11,152
它的出现就等于是在告诉读者：that后面紧接着的句子是要作为另一个句子的某一个成分来使用的

26
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,418
不是要表达的核心意思

27
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:17,725
因此 当读者读到“That English is important…”

28
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:25,766
他就会知道这个句子的核心意思并没有讲出来 他一定会期待着句子接下来的中心意思

29
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:30,472
当他读到“…is an undoubted fact”时 他知道了

30
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:33,593
句子要表达的意思是“英语很重要

31
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:38,153
这是一个毋庸置疑的事实” 而不是要说“英语很重要”

32
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:43,259
例句1） The criminal confessed his sins killed many people.

33
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,206
例句2） The criminal confessed that his sins

34
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,233
killed many people.

35
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:53,287
这名罪犯承认 他的罪行伤害了很多人

36
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:56,513
对于例句2） 因为有了that的存在

37
00:02:56,514 --> 00:03:01,420
我们能轻而易举地判断出the criminal confessed是主句

38
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:07,874
而his sins killed many people是宾语从句 因而缩短了理解的时间

39
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:11,687
He said no word at the meeting was strange.

40
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:13,314
对于这个句子

41
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:21,368
很多读者自然会将其当作宾语从句理解：“He said that no word at the meeting was strange.”

42
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:28,048
此时句子的意思是：他说 会上人们的发言都很正常 并没有什么奇怪的

43
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,114
但是

44
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:37,501
如果在句首添加一个that而将其改写为“ That he said no word at the meeting was strange.”

45
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:43,542
此时则要理解成：他在会上一言不发 这真让人觉得有些蹊跷

46
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:47,502
那么为什么宾语从句中的that可以省去呢？

47
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:54,968
这是因为对于宾语从句 主句的谓语已经出现 谓语后面所接的成分自然是宾语

48
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:58,022
所以在不影响句子意思的情况下

49
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:00,102
可以把that省去

50
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,955
比如“I think you are right.

51
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:06,529
或“I think that you are right.”都可以

52
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:07,596
但是

53
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:11,742
像上面的例句The criminal confessed that his sins

54
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:16,889
killed many people. 即使是宾语从句 that也不宜省去

55
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,370
一般疑问句作句子成分

56
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,690
用whether或if引导

57
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,610
当把一个一般疑问句当作名词来使用时

58
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,956
需要先将疑问句的倒装语序变成陈述句语序

59
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:37,890
并在句首加上whether或if（if只用在宾语从句中）来引导 以保留原句的疑问意义

60
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,890
然后

61
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,343
用“whether 加

62
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:47,504
陈述句”这一结构分别充当另一个句子的主语、宾语、表语或同位语等四种成分

63
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:54,437
即构成主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句或同位语从句等四种名词从句

64
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:57,157
那么用使用if还是whether呢？

65
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:02,011
对于if和whether这两个连词 其用法有以下区别：

66
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,264
if一般只用于引导宾语从句

67
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:10,758
而whether可引导包括宾语从句在内的其他名词从句

68
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:13,491
比如下面这个句子不合适：

69
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:16,465
If he comes or not makes no

70
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,958
difference.

71
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,105
他来不来无关紧要

72
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:24,611
应改为“Whether he comes or not makes no difference.”

73
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:28,252
这里是主语从句 应由whether引导

74
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,772
下面这个句子也不合适：

75
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:33,998
The question is if he will come.

76
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,265
问题是他是否会来

77
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:40,172
应改为“The question is whether he will come.”

78
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,839
这里是表语从句 应由whether引导

79
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,986
if不和or not直接连用 即一般不说if or not 但可以说if … or not

80
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:53,253
而whether没有此限制

81
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:57,907
错误的例句1）I don t know if or not he comes.

82
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:02,667
正确的例句2）I don t know whether or not he comes.

83
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,014
我不知道他是否会来

84
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:12,107
例句1）错误 因为if和or not不能直接连用 即不能说成if or not

85
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:17,281
特殊疑问句作句子成分 要变倒装语序为陈述句语序

86
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:21,134
当把一个特殊疑问句当作名词来使用时

87
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:25,481
需要先将疑问句的倒装语序变成陈述句语序

88
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:31,868
然后分别充当另一个句子的主语、宾语、表语或同位语等四种成分

89
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:38,815
即构成主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句或同位语从句等四种名词从句

90
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:42,882
特殊疑问词作主语 无需调整句子语序

91
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,936
如果特殊疑问词在句中作主语

92
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:50,149
则特殊疑问句无需调整语序而直接作成分

93
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:54,042
因为此时的问句即是一个陈述句语序

94
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:57,163
例句1） Who will chair the meeting?

95
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,563
谁将会主持这个会议？

96
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:03,683
例句2） Who will chair the meeting has not yet

97
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:05,523
been decided.

98
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:09,469
谁将会主持这个会议 目前还没有决定

99
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:13,349
在例句1）中 特殊疑问词who作主语

100
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,803
此时整个问句“Who will chair the meeting?”

101
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,683
是一个“主语 加

102
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:24,830
谓语”结构的陈述句语序 因此用该问句作成分时 无需调整语序

103
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,924
而直接在例句2）中充当主语

104
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:30,137
构成一个主语从句

105
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:31,697
主语从句

106
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:33,484
陈述句作主语

107
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:39,897
把“that 加 陈述句”这一结构放在主语的位置即构成主语从句

108
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:44,804
That the seas are being overfished has been known for years.

109
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:50,204
海洋正在被人类过度捕捞 多年以来这已是尽人皆知的

110
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:58,511
这里that引导的从句that the seas are being overfished是一个主语从句 直接置于主语的位置

111
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:06,645
That English is important is an undoubted fact.英语很重要 这是一个毋庸置疑的事实

112
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,978
That he doesn t understand English is

113
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,339
obvious.

114
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,939
很显然 他不懂英语

115
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,565
That the world is round is a fact.地球是圆的 这是一个事实

116
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:27,352
对于陈述句作主语 更常见的是用it作形式主语置于句首 而将主语从句放在句末

117
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:30,313
因此上面各句可分别改为：

118
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:35,539
It has been known for years that the seas are being overfished.

119
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,353
It is an undoubted fact that English is important.

120
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,686
It is obvious that he doesn t understand English.

121
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,953
It is a fact that the world is round.

122
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:52,154
下列都是常见的主语从句句型（重点内容）：

123
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:54,807
It is 加 过去分词 加

124
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:56,341
that从句

125
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,248
It s

126
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,981
reported that…（据报道……）

127
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:03,101
It s believed that…（人们相信……）

128
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:05,394
It is generally thought

129
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,821
that…（人们普遍认为……）

130
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:11,061
It should be noted that…（应当注意……）

131
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:14,475
It has been found that…（现已发现……）

132
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,288
It

133
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,835
must be pointed out that…（必须指出……）

134
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:24,742
类似动词还有say expect know estimate和forecast等

135
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:28,289
It is 加 形容词 加 that从句

136
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:30,943
It is clear that…（显然……）

137
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:32,076
It is

138
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:34,703
possible that…（很可能……）

139
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:35,836
It is

140
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:38,303
likely that…（很可能……）

141
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,237
It is natural that…（很自然……）

142
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,797
It is certain

143
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,917
that…（可以相信……）

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,677
It is strange

145
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,797
that…（奇怪的是……）

146
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,103
It is fortunate that…（幸运的是……）

147
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,130
It is necessary

148
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,090
that…（有必要……）

149
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,943
It is true that

150
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:02,050
English is becoming an international language.

151
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,437
的确 英语正日益成为一门国际通用语言

152
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:10,038
It is 加 名词短语 加 that从句

153
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:17,411
常用的名词有：a pity a shame an honor a good idea和no wonder等等

154
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:20,505
It is a pity that…（可惜的是……）

155
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:23,532
It is a fact that…（事实是……）

156
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,852
It is good news that…（……真是太好了）

157
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:27,998
It is

158
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,159
a good thing that…（……真是件好事）

159
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,065
It is no wonder that…（难怪……）

160
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,985

It is an honor that…（真荣幸……）

00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:45,519
It is common knowledge that…（……是常识）

164
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,359
It is my belief

that…（我相信……）

166
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,613
It is a miracle that…（……真是奇迹）

167
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:56,586
It is common knowledge that the whale is not a fish.

168
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,733
鲸鱼不是鱼类 这是一个常识

169
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:06,173
It is a shame that you did not pass the test. 你没通过这次考试 真遗憾

170
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:14,667
一般疑问句作主语时 要把一般疑问句变成陈述句 并且用whether来引导 然后充当句子的主语

171
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,788
即构成主语从句

172
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:21,374
Whether he comes or not makes no difference to me.

173
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:24,081
他来不来对我来说无所谓

174
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:28,668
Whether he comes or not makes no difference to me.

175
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:32,535
特殊疑问句作主语时 比如例句如下：

176
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:35,735
What we need is a wholly new kind of

177
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,389
police force.

178
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:40,629
我们需要的是一个全新的警察机构

179
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:45,176
What we need is a wholly new kind of police force.

180
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:55,389
这里的特殊疑问词what是作need的宾语 所以需将原来的倒装句what do we need调整为陈述句语序what we need

181
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,310
然后作主句的主语 即构成主语从句

182
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,283
When the meeting is to be held has not yet been decided.

183
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,976
会议何时举行还没决定

184
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:15,403
这里的特殊疑问词when是作从句的时间状语 所以需将原来的倒装句when is the meeting to be

185
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:21,777
held调整为陈述句语序when the meeting is to be held 然后作主句的主语

186
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:23,964
即构成主语从句

187
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:29,857
How a person masters his fate is more important than what his fate is.

188
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:36,978
对于一个人来说 重要的是如何掌握自己的命运 而不是被动地接受命运的安排

189
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:42,871
How a person masters his fate is more important than what his fate is.

190
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,978
这里的特殊疑问词how是作从句的方式状语

191
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:51,631
所以需将原来的倒装句how does a person master his

192
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:58,098
fate调整为陈述句语序how a person masters his fate 然后作主句的主语

193
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,285
即构成主语从句

194
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:09,059
September 11 2001 started out as an ordinary day but what happened that morning will be forever

195
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,286
etched（铭刻） in our memories.

196
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:21,366
2001年9月11日那天和平日一样到来 但是那天早晨发生的事情将永远铭刻在人们的记忆里

197
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,752
September 11

198
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:34,273
2001 started out as an ordinary day but what happened that morning will be forever etched（铭刻） in our memories.

199
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:40,126
这里的特殊疑问词what是作从句的主语 所以无需调整语序

200
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:46,727
而直接将疑问句what happened that morning作主句的主语 即构成主语从句

201
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,287
宾语从句

202
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:56,100
陈述句作宾语 把“that+陈述句”这一结构放在宾语的位置即构成宾语从句

203
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,341
We know (that) the world is round.

204
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:01,887
我们知道 地球是圆的

205
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:08,274
只有宾语从句中的that才可以省去（在不影响对句意的理解的情况下）

206
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:14,275
而主语从句、表语从句和同位语从句中的that一般不能省去

207
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:17,528
that在宾语从句中省略的问题

208
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:20,368
I once read that “the beauty of

209
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:24,275
life is its changes” and that “the art of life

210
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:29,328
lies in a constant readjustment to our surroundings”.

211
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:37,982
我曾经读到过这样一句话：“生活的魅力在于变化 而生活的艺术在于不断地适应周围环境的变化

212
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:49,223
I once read that “the beauty of life is its changes” and that “the art of life lies in a constant readjustment to our surroundings”.

213
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:53,836
句中含有两个that从句 连词that一般不省去

214
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:59,769
这里两个that从句作read的宾语 即构成并列的宾语从句

215
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,890
一般疑问句作宾语

216
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:10,130
把“whether 或者 if 加 陈述句”这一结构放在宾语的位置即构成宾语从句

217
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,503
I don t know if 或者 whether he needs my help.

218
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:17,463
我不知道他是否需要我的帮助

219
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:21,503
No one knew whether interest rates would rise.

220
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,477
没有人知道利率是否会上升

221
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:28,944
这里原来的一般疑问句是would interest rates rise

222
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:37,437
变成陈述句语序后成为interest rates would rise 然后为了保留疑问的意义又添加了whether or not

223
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,250
构成宾语从句

224
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:43,851
一般不说if or not 所以这里的连词不宜用if

225
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:46,024
特殊疑问句作宾语

226
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:52,251
把特殊疑问句变成陈述句语序后放在宾语的位置即构成宾语从句

227
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,251
I have not decided whom I should vote for.

228
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,904
我还没有决定该投谁一票

229
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:03,011
这里的特殊疑问词whom是作vote for的宾语

230
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:09,571
所以需将原来的倒装句whom should I vote for调整为陈述句语序whom

231
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:10,384
I

232
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:17,024
should vote for 然后作主句谓语decided的宾语 即构成宾语从句

233
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:21,037
No one knows exactly how speech began.

234
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:24,744
没有人确切地知道语言是如何产生的

235
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:29,158
这里的特殊疑问词how是作began的方式状语

236
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:35,411
所以需将原来的倒装句how did speech begin调整为陈述句语序how

237
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,545
speech

238
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:42,172
began 然后作主句谓语knows的宾语 即构成宾语从句

239
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,705
表语从句

240
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:51,665
陈述句作表语 把“that 加 陈述句”这一结构放在表语的位置即构成表语从句

241
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,999
My idea is that the child should be sent to school.

242
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:59,972
我的看法是 应该把这个孩子送去上学

243
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:08,319
一般疑问句作表语 把“whether 加 陈述句”这一结构放在表语的位置即构成表语从句

244
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,866
My concern is whether he comes or not.

245
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,573
我关心的是他到底来不来

246
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,747
特殊疑问句作表语

247
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:22,947
把特殊疑问句变成陈述句语序后放在表语的位置即构成表语从句

248
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:27,081
Change is what keeps us fresh and innovative.

249
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:30,894
Change is what keeps us from getting stale.

250
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:31,934
Change

251
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,535
is what keeps us young.

252
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:38,468
变革能使我们保持思维敏锐 富有创造性

253
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:41,121
变革能防止我们思想僵化

254
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:43,788
变革能使我们永葆青春

255
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,122
Yesterday is history.

256
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,348
Tomorrow is a mystery.

257
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,242
Today is a gift.

258
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:53,282
That s why it s called the present!

259
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,922
昨天是历史

260
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:56,562
明天是一个谜

261
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:58,495
今天是一个礼物

262
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,175
因此它才被称为present!

263
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:04,708
The point is when you will become rich.

264
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,922
问题的关键是你何时才能有钱

265
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,682
同位语从句

266
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:13,802
所谓同位语 就是用来补充说明名词的成分

267
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:17,256
被补充说明的名词 叫作先行词

268
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:23,243
当用一个完整的句子来补充说明名词时 即构成同位语从句

269
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:33,483
所以 同位语从句都位于一个名词的后面 便构成了“名词 加 连词 加 同位语从句”这样的结构

270
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:41,456
陈述句作同位语是 把“that陈述句”这一结构放在同位语的位置即构成同位语从句

271
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:48,790
He was prepared to prove his theory that two different weights would fall to the ground at the

272
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,377
same time.

273
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:55,897
他准备证明他的这一理论：两个重量不同的物体将同时落地

274
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:58,604
这里的先行词是his theory

275
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:05,005
同位语从句是that two different weights would fall to the ground at the same time

276
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:09,845
再读一遍句子：He was prepared to prove his theory that

277
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:14,711
two different weights would fall to the ground at the same time.

278
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:18,658
The fact that he succeeded in the experiment

279
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,938
pleased everybody.

280
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:24,885
他的实验取得了成功 这让大家很高兴

281
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:30,659
The fact that he succeeded in the experiment pleased everybody.

282
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,219
这里的先行词是the fact

283
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,833
同位语从句是that he succeeded in the experiment

284
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,646
The rumor that Tom was a thief turned out to be

285
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,740
untrue.

286
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,833
有谣传说汤姆是小偷 结果证明是假的

287
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:52,193
这里的先行词是the rumor 同位语从句是that Tom was a thief

288
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:58,460
要特别注意 同位语从句可能与其修饰的名词被其他成分隔开

289
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,327
They spread the lie everywhere that Tom was guilty of theft.

290
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:11,928
这里的先行词the lie与同位语从句that Tom was guilty of theft被状语everywhere隔开

291
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:15,728
他们到处散布谣言说汤姆犯有盗窃罪

292
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:19,421
A saying goes that practice makes perfect.

293
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,981
俗话说 熟能生巧

294
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:27,448
这里的先行词a saying与同位语从句that practice makes

295
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:30,115
perfect被谓语goes隔开

296
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:35,222
同位语从句句型（一）：名词 加 that 加 陈述句

297
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:37,276
I have been left with

298
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:40,356
the knowledge that it's better to expect

299
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:44,876
nothing than to give everything and then be disappointed.

300
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:50,476
我从中懂得了 不抱任何期待比付出努力却最终失望要好

301
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:53,702
I have been left with the knowledge that it's

302
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:59,782
better to expect nothing than to give everything and then be disappointed.

303
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:05,423
同位语从句句型（二）：名词+定语+that+陈述句

304
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:09,756
如果一个名词后面既有定语又有同位语从句

305
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:18,583
那么往往定语在前 同位语从句在后 这样便形成了先行词与同位语从句被定语分隔的结构

306
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:25,997
The statement by the driver of the vehicle that he did not see the lorry was rejected by the

307
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:26,998
Court.

308
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:32,731
该汽车司机说自己没有看见卡车 但法庭并不相信这个说法

309
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:36,771
The statement by the driver of the vehicle that he

310
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:41,092
did not see the lorry was rejected by the Court.

311
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,985
the statement by the driver of the

312
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:50,959
vehicle表示“这位汽车司机的陈述” 即用介词短语来限定statement the statement...

313
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,252
that he did not see the

314
00:21:53,253 --> 00:22:02,466
lorry表示“他说没有看见卡车这一陈述” 即同位语从句用来详细说明statement的内容是什么

315
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:08,107
同位语从句句型（三）：名词+谓语+that+陈述句

316
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,267
如果一个名词作主语

317
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:18,320
并且它后面还带有一个同位语从句 此时我们通常把这个同位语从句置于谓语的后面

318
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,467
而不是放在名词的后面

319
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:24,774
因而造成先行名词与同位语从句的分隔

320
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:28,241
Concerns were raised that witnesses might be

321
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:32,494
encouraged to exaggerate their stories in court to

322
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:35,001
ensure guilty verdicts.

323
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:44,161
人们日益担心 证人可能会受到鼓励 在法庭上夸大其词以确保陪审团对被告做出有罪的判决

324
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:54,161
Concerns were raised that witnesses might be encouraged to exaggerate their stories in court to ensure guilty verdicts.

325
00:22:54,161 --> 00:23:00,894
这里的先行词concerns与that引导的同位语从句被谓语were raised隔开

326
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:03,201
一般疑问句作同位语

327
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,641
把“whether 加

328
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:09,827
陈述句”这一结构放在同位语的位置即构成同位语从句

329
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:13,494
They are faced with the problem whether they

330
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,828
should continue to work .

331
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:20,228
他们面临这样一个问题：他们是否应该继续工作

332
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:22,535
特殊疑问句作同位语

333
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:29,402
把特殊疑问句变成陈述句语序后放在同位语的位置即构成同位语从句

334
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:34,003
There arose the question of where we could get the loan.

335
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:37,909
现在的问题是我们去哪里弄到这笔贷款

336
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,483
I have no idea when he will return.

337
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:43,963
我不知道他什么时候回来

338
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,497
嵌套结构

339
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:53,284
所谓名词从句的“嵌套结构” 即指多个名词从句之间存在的包含与被包含的关系

340
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:59,284
I realized that what I said was not exactly what I meant to say.

341
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:04,497
我后来意识到 当时所说的话并非是我真正想要说的

342
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:10,498
I realized that what I said was not exactly what I meant to say.

343
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:16,684
在that引导的宾语从句中同时含有what引导的主语从句 what I

344
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:21,245
said和what引导的表语从句what I meant to say

345
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:25,085
The question is how what you have learned can be

346
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:27,191
put into practice.

347
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:31,605
问题是 你所学到的知识如何才能应用于实践

348
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:35,445
The question is how what you have learned can be

349
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:37,551
put into practice.

350
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:43,805
在how引导的表语从句中含有what引导的主语从句what you have learned

351
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:48,258
how引导的从句的谓语是can be put into practice

352
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:52,071
而what引导的从句的谓语是have learned

353
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,632
连词与动词的配比原则

354
00:24:54,632 --> 00:25:01,458
在分析句子结构时 我们可以先找到句中的各个谓语动词 然后再找连词

355
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:07,512
又因为连词后面必然是从句 而从句中必然有谓语动词 因此

356
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:13,219
在每个连词后面必然要找到一个与之相应的从句的谓语动词

357
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:20,433
当把连词与对应的谓语动词划分清楚之后 整个难句的结构也就迎刃而解了

358
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:28,247
在英语中 有N个谓语动词 就会对应有N-1个连词以及N-1个对应的从句

359
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:32,808
这就是张满胜老师提出的“连词与动词的配比原则”
